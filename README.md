iHaskell notebook introducing functional languages

For help installing the iHaskell kernel, see [here](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell) (general) or [here](http://remusao.github.io/install-ihaskell-on-ubuntu-1404-with-stack.html) (on `Ubuntu` through `stack`). For the latter, OSX instructions should be pretty similar: just replace `apt` with `brew` or `fink` or whatever.

If you just want to view the presentation non-interactively, you can do so in the [functional.html](https://github.com/devonhollowood/ihaskell-functional/blob/master/functional.html) file.
